Todo Items:

  * Make it work!
  * OPEN:
    * Notify upon invalid (too short) of message data
  * Detect BGP identifier clashes
  * Constraint violation in message classes shouldn't kill everything
    (example: a capability with an invalid length to pass the from-raw
    anonymous constraints)
  * If listening port cannot be bound, something bad should happen - it
    should not just silently fail.
  * In messages, parameters, capabilities, and path attributes, we
    should test for the message type in a uniform way.
